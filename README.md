# SpaceDivision

An analytical project where my colleagues and I were asked to create a data visualization based on the data set given, then we also created a dashboard that became a place for us to show the results of our work and a story to present the dashboard we made.

In this project I was responsible for:
- Conducting brainstorming related to the division of tasks
- Performing the data transformation process to make data in accordance with the data type
- Creating diagrams with analytic logic (Pie Chart, Bar Chart, Symbol Map Chart)
- Creating dashboards and stories to accommodate the diagrams that have been made
- Create documentation and diagramming procedures per scenario

Tools used in this project:
